title: Release 1.4.2
---

This is a minor bugfix release that fixes the following issues:

* Translate empty strings into `NULL` instead of 0.0 for columns of type double.
* Consistently quote table names to handle upper case table prefixes correctly.
* Avoid querying geometries in stage 2 of the flex output when expiry is disabled.
* Fix syntax error in index creation with schema enabled.

The release also adds a new `osm2pgsql-replication` script to simplify the
process of downloading and applying updates. It requires pyosmium and psycopg2.
