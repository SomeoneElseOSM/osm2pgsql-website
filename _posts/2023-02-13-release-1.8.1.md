title: Release 1.8.1
---

This release contains some fixes and minor changes.

* Fix `osm2pgsql-replication` script so it works correctly with PostgreSQL schemas.
* Don't process objects without tags in outputs in append mode. This should speed up updates a little bit.
* Count number of inserted rows and rows not inserted because of NOT NULL constraints for each table and log the numbers in debug mode.
* Remove some extra-verbose debug logging when using the `pole_of_inaccessibility()` function.
* Flush output tables generated from nodes and ways tables earlier.
