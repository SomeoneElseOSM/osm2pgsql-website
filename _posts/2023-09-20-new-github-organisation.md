title: New Github Organisation
---

Today we switched all osm2pgsql repositories from the "openstreetmap"
organization on Github to a new Github organization called
[osm2pgsql-dev](https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/). We want to make it is
easier for our users to find all the pieces in our growing osm2pgsql ecosystem.
There is...

* the [main osm2pgsql repository](https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/osm2pgsql)
  with the source code,
* the [website repository](https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/osm2pgsql-website)
  which contains everything needed to maintain our website and documention,
* and the recently released [Themepark
  repository](https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/osm2pgsql-themepark).

All the old links will continue to work. If you access the old repository
links, you will be forwarded to the new places automatically.
