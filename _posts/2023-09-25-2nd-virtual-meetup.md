title: Second Virtual Meetup on osm2pgsql
---

In 2021 we, the osm2pgsql developers and users, had a first virtual meetup.
And now we want to do it again. We want to talk a bit about new features
and chat about where we might want to go. But mostly this is a chance for
osm2pgsql users to get questions answered and their feedback heard.

The meeting will take place [online](https://meet.topf.org/osm2pgsql) on
October 10th, 2023 starting 18:00 UTC. Anybody can join, you don't need to
register. See you there!
