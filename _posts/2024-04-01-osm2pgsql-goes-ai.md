title: Osm2pgsql goes AI
---

Looks like Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going to solve all the worlds
problems. And we here at osm2pgsql headquarters certainly don't want to be left
out. Also all the research funding these days goes towards AI and we certainly
don't wan to be left out of that.

So at the last [hack weekend in
Karlsruhe](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Karlsruhe_Hack_Weekend_February_2024)
we asked the younger generation who knows about this AI stuff to help us out
with making osm2pgsql fit for the future.

Isaac Boates stepped up and talked ChatGPT into working for us. As a promising
first step, the AI helped us solve the biggest problem osm2pgsql had: We didn't
have a logo. The AI came up with [a few logo
ideas](https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/osm2pgsql-website/issues/59) for
osm2pgsql. The AI was a bit obsessive about the paintbrush it absolutely wanted
to include in the image, but nothing a bit of fiddling with Gimp couldn't
solve. So now we finally have an <b>official logo</b> for osm2pgsql! This AI
stuff is really neat!

We are looking forward to all the other great achievements AI has in store for
us!
