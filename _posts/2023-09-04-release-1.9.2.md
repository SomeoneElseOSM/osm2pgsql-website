title: Release 1.9.2
---

This [release](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/releases/tag/1.9.2)
fixes a bug introduced in 1.9.0 with two-stage processing that will lead to
crashes. If you are using any 1.9.x version, please upgrade to 1.9.2.

In one case we had some performance problems updating an osm2pgsql database
with 1.9.1 due to the PostgreSQL query planning choosing a bad plan. This
release contains a workaround for that problem.

We also improved the (experimental) generalizer code a bit:

* More information is shown in log level 'info', including some timing
  information.
* The Lua config `run_sql()` command now can have either a single SQL statement
  in the `sql` field (as before) or a list of SQL commands.
* For convenience, the Lua config `run_sql()` command now has an optional
  `transaction` field which can be set to `true` to wrap the SQL commands in
  BEGIN/COMMIT.
* The new `if_has_rows` fields on the `run_sql()` command can be set to string
  with an SQL query. If that field is set, the SQL statement(s) in the `sql`
  field is only run, if the SQL query returns at least one row.
* Some performance improvements in low-level code in the generalizer.
