When starting out with osm2pgsql there is often the question: How large is
the resulting database going to be and how long will the import take?

The invariable answer is, of course, "it depends". But that's not very useful.
Using the [new server sponsored by
FOSSGIS](https://osm2pgsql.org/news/2022/08/30/new-test-server.html) we ran
lots of imports with different configurations and different input data from the
Switzerland extract to the full planet and wrote down the results in a new
["Sizing" appendix in the manual](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#sizing).
This will give you at least some idea on what to expect.
