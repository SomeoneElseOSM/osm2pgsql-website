This release finally drops support for old-style multipolygons.

Doing so allowed a major overhaul of the processing pipeline.
Imports are now entirely done in the first processing stage. The second,
much slower processing stage is only needed when updating existing
databases. Data is entirely streamed into the database using COPY, which
reduces the number of database connections needed.

Other major changes include

- better error handling in Lua backend
- process all OSM objects again when extra attributes are requested
- enable running tests in pg_virtualenv
- add support for configurable Gazetteer style
- allow to disable RAM node cache with -C 0
