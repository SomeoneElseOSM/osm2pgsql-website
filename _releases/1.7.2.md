    - Small changes only

This release has some small changes only:

* The flex output now allows tables with only the id column (or columns).
* The `osm2pgsql-replication` script now always expects the `osm2pgsql`
  binary to be in same path as itself.
* Adds the flag `--middle-schema=SCHEMA` to the `osm2pgsql-replication`
  script which allows placing the replication status table in a schema
  other than PUBLIC (Thanks to @JakobMiksch).
* More tests have been converted to the new BDD format.
* Various code cleanups and refactorings especially in the expire code.
