title: Version 1.9.0
version: 1.9.0
date: 2023-08-15
manpages:
    - osm2pgsql
    - osm2pgsql-replication
highlights:
    - New osm2pgsql_properties table
    - New experimental database middle format
    - New experimental generalization support
    - Schemas are handled differently
---

This release brings three new major features:

* a new osm2pgsql_properties table that saves command line options and reuses
  them on updates
* a new database middle saves raw OSM data in JSONB format and is explicitly
  designed to be queried by the user
* the new (and still experimental) osm2pgsql-gen adds geometry generalization
  to osm2pgsql

Other changes include:

* cleanup of schema handling
* tile expiry output into database tables
* a new `spherical_area()` function for flex config files to calculate the area
  of a (multi)polygon on the sphere.
* when using the new database middle, the `--middle-with-nodes` option allows
  you to store all tagged nodes in the database (with their tags and location).
* several improvements to osm2pgsql-replication to make it more flexible and
  better tested (thanks to @amandasaurus  and @JakobMiksch)
* don't do multi-statement SQL queries to be compatible with the PgPool-II
  connection pooler.

Please note that this version drops support for implicit DB schema other than
public. If you rely on implict user schemas or custom schema paths, you now
must configure the schema to be used with the `--schema` option.
