    - Fix bug in style file reader
---

This is a bugfix release with only minor changes.

Changes:

* Fix parsing problems in style file reader. Some variables were not
  initialized correctly when parsing a style file, which lead to some
  surprising behaviour with flags of one config line re-used by the next
  if the flags field of that line was empty. This could also have lead to
  buffer overflows in the first line being parsed.
* Fix: When there is an active progress display, log messages would show up
  after the progress display instead of the next line.
* Release some allocated memory earlier in the processing chain.
* Fix confusing log message: The message "Done postprocessing on table '{}'
  in {}" was logged twice when `--drop` is used. This changes one of the log
  messages to the more specific "Table '{}' dropped in {}".
* Run ANALYZE on middle tables only in create mode saving some processing
  time.
* Add 'status' command to `osm2pgsql-replication`. Prints the current
  replication status, and with `--json` prints that as JSON data.
* Needs at least CMake 3.5.0 now.
* Updates the included versions of the catch2, fmt, libosmium, and protozero
  libraries to current versions.

Note that this is the last version which will compile with C++14. The next
version 1.6.0 will need C++17.
