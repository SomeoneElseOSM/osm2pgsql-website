This is a bug fix release.

Changes include

- limit number of buffers queued for COPYing to PostgreSQL
  to avoid out-of-memory issues when importing data in slim
  mode without the flatnode option
- reduce default number of threads to 4 to avoid running
  out of PostgreSQL connections
- fix import failures when importing large values into
  int4 columns
