  PyOsmium installed.
* Ignore relations with more than 32.000 members (which should never happen
  in real data) instead of failing.
* Removed the dependency on boost::algorithm.
* Included libosmium was updated to newest version 2.17.3 which contains
  an important fix for a problem which can lead to osm2pgsql locking up.
