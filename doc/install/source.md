---

If you can't use the packaged version of osm2pgsql for your distribution, you
can always install from source.

* To install the latest release, download the
  [latest release](https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/osm2pgsql/releases/latest)
  as `tar.gz` or `zip` file and unpack it.
* To install a version from git, get it with `git clone
  https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/osm2pgsql`.

See the *Building* section in the
[`README.md`](https://github.com/osm2pgsql-dev/osm2pgsql/blob/master/README.md)
for a list of dependencies and build instructions.
